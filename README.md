This repository will hold the code and project files for a custom program that generates compositions for paintings resembling textile weavings, fabric mending techniques, and patchwork. Physical paintings will be produced based off of the generated outputs as an ongoing series and practice. For each completed painting, OpenCV, a computer vision library, will be used to extract and compile feature data, such as corners, edges, shapes, and colors. There are links to the first couple of works to be found in the [Loop](https://verse.loop.onland.io/NM5qKAC/eileen) show space. Much of the work in their current states are in the beginning stages, and, with repetition, are intended to grow dynamically over time. Visitors are encouraged to revisit the portal at various times throughout the show, as a new pinecone or a flower link may be added at different times. The portal space is called "Topiaries," referencing the gardening practice of training plants to take on precise geometric shapes.
