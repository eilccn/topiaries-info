I was interested in information foraging theory and how the act of foraging relates to the way we may navigate through digital, internet, or video game worlds. At around the time that I began developing an interactive fiction game at the start of the year, I also started learning how to knit and sew, realizing that an integration of tactile or more traditional forms of object making with software and digital mediums is something that I'd like to explore. This repository will hold the code and project files for a custom program that generates compositions for paintings resembling textile weavings, fabric mending techniques, and patchwork. I plan on producing physical paintings based off of the generated outputs as an ongoing series. For each completed painting, I will also use OpenCV, a computer vision library, to extract and compile feature data, such as corners, edges, shapes, and colors. There are links to the first couple of works to be found in the show space. Much of my work in their current states are in the beginning stages, and, with consistency and repetition, will grow dynamically over time. Visitors are encouraged to revisit the portal at various times throughout the show, as I will go back to the portal just to add a new pinecone or a flower link. The portal space is called "Topiaries," referencing the gardening practice of training plants to take on precise geometric shapes.
