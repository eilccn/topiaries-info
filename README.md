#### Loop Critique Residency 7: recent ancient open-source analog encrypted garden memory

[...] a plant's goal-directed behavior is towards thriving; its various systems are geared towards providing its needs and the intervention of pruning and shaping works along- side these needs. A tree will always be shaped to a certain extent by its environment: the nutrients available, the prevailing wind and so on. Admittedly, it takes human intervention to shape it as a cube, but it can stil thrive in that environment. The topiarist's concern is not just for a tree that looks like a cube, but one that is still a living, thriving tree. The resulting tree no longer looks like one of its species as depicted in a field guide, but then neither would one that germinated next to a wall or under dense tree cover. In managing the environment so that the tree thrives the topiarist has an important goal of the tree at heart.
