# Garden Of Loom

[Garden Of Loom: Interactive Fiction Game](https://eilccn.itch.io/garden-of-loom)

Garden of Loom is a story-driven puzzle and exploration game set in a mysterious, magical garden where weaving and gardening intertwine. Conversation and narrative generation AI techniques were used to create an immersive and interactive experience that adapts to players' choices and discoveries. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo, the game features dynamic conversations with NPCs, allowing players to ask questions, explore backstories, and delve deeper into the mysteries of the garden. 

In the game, players take on the role of a young apprentice weaver named Lyra, who discovers a secret garden where the plants and creatures are made of living threads. As Lyra collects materials for crafting new clothing designs, she solves weaving-based puzzles using the natural materials in the garden. Each puzzle offers a new way to create a garment or textile pattern, and successfully solving puzzles unlocks encounters with creatures that reveal strange stories and histories behind the garden.

**********************************

Note: This current version of Garden of Loom is an initial prototype. The developer is working to improve the narrative and conversation generation so that it is not as repetitive at times. More interesting puzzles will also be added, and the assets will be replaced with hand knit landscapes, garments, plants, and creatures. In future iterations, the game will hopefully be transformed into an open world and exploration game.
